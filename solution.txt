Can I have your account number?\n\n**Customer:** It's 12349876.\n\n**Agent:** I see the charge was $89.99 instead of $59.99. That’s a billing error on our part.\n\n**Customer:** Can it be fixed?\n\n**Agent:** Absolutely. I’ve initiated a refund for the extra $30. It should reflect in 3–5 days.\n\n**Customer:** Thank you for sorting that out!\n\n**Agent:** My pleasure! Let me know if you need anything else.\n", 'file': 'case2.md'}]
