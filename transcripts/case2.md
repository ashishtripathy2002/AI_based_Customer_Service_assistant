**Customer:** Hello, I was overcharged on my last bill.

**Agent:** I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Can I have your account number?

**Customer:** It's 12349876.

**Agent:** I see the charge was $89.99 instead of $59.99. That’s a billing error on our part.

**Customer:** Can it be fixed?

**Agent:** Absolutely. I’ve initiated a refund for the extra $30. It should reflect in 3–5 days.

**Customer:** Thank you for sorting that out!

**Agent:** My pleasure! Let me know if you need anything else.
