**Customer:** My package was supposed to arrive two days ago and it still hasn’t shown up.

**Agent:** I apologize for the delay. Can I have your tracking number?

**Customer:** Sure, it’s TRK123456.

**Agent:** Looks like there was a weather-related delay. It's now expected to arrive tomorrow.

**Customer:** That makes sense. Thanks for checking.

**Agent:** No problem! I’ll also send you a $5 coupon for the inconvenience.

**Customer:** Much appreciated!

**Agent:** Anytime! Let me know if there's anything else I can help with.
